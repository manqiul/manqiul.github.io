Hello! I'm Manqiu, a Georgia Tech `graduate student`, aspiring `data scientist`, and `photography lover`. I would describe myself as a creative idea practitioner, and I want to contribute to the development of products that are both inspiring and beneficial to users. :seedling: Projects I've been working on recently are: `Professional Skills Extraction using NER` and `Big Data Visualization`.
