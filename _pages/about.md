Hello! I'm Manqiu, a Georgia Tech `graduate student`, aspiring `data scientist`, and `photography lover`. I'm primarily interested in product analysis and want to contribute to the development of products that are both inspiring and beneficial to users. I would describe myself as an enthusiast and practitioner of creative ideas.

You can find my [projects](https://manqiul.github.io/projects/), notes, [photos](https://manqiul.github.io/photography/), and yearly [reading list](https://manqiul.github.io/reading/) on this website. My previous experiences and most recent updates are listed below. Please feel free to browse the site and leave comments!
